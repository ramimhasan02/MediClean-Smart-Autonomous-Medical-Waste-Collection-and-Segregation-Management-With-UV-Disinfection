# MediClean-Smart-Autonomous-Medical-Waste-Collection-and-Segregation-Management-With-UV-Disinfection

MediClean, a deep learning-powered autonomous robot for smart medical waste management.

Designed the robot to navigate healthcare facilities, detect, classify, segregate, and collect various types of medical waste without human intervention.

Trained a custom deep learning model to classify waste into four different categories 

Integrated a UV-based sterilization system into the robot to ensure continuous disinfection of the floor.

Built a comprehensive medical waste image dataset from scratch using real-world data from BUET Medical Center, supplemented with a Kaggle dataset for robust model training and evaluation.
